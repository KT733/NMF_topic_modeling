# topic-modeling-using-nmf
## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing the 20 Newsgroups dataset using the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) technique. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of newsgroup documents, organized into 20 different categories, making it a popular benchmark for text classification and topic modeling tasks. In this project, we apply NMF to extract meaningful topics from the text data and gain insights into the underlying structure of the documents.
